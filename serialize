Serialize: 

YAML is an insecure method to keep info saved, therefore we want to SERIALIZE. 

Serialize: 

the serialize method takes a secod parameter which isn a class that define the coder to use to serialize the data. 

Then we can create an object that is going to be saved using JSON. 

Pros: 
 - normally you have to create a database table that represents your data correctly
 - with serialze you can store these regular pieces of data but without createing special fields for it
 
 Example: 
 
 User has an adress, email, birthday
  def a user table with name user password, and then details
  IN details you can store what ever you want (address, email, bday) as a JSON object
  Then later when you call user.details it will send back a hash of the objects
  Then you can grab specific keys out of that details hash by user.details["birthday"]
