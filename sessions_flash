Difference between sessions/flash/cookies = what they are used for and how long, they all persist different types of data

sessions are the user state persisting through the application

cookies: how the server recognizes you, most often used for bookmarking you location on a page
  - has an expiration that is defined as an absolute date or can exprire when a session end


Sessions: 



current user def goes in application controller

login logout defs go in sessions controller
sessions persist data between requests
 - places where you store canonical data
 
 

Flash: 
- a flash is a hash that is immediately cleared after it is used
- flash will show when you move to a new page - warning, message, etc.. 
- dont need to require anywhere
- built in expiration method: you can set it to last for however long you want
   - you can specify that time 
useful for error messages
- in your sessions controller you can user flash to say "Logged out" etc.. 
- flash can be in controllers, erb pages, 
flash.keep - will carry ober 
flash.now - wont switch the page with the flash 

When you go to another page is when the flash message will show up
