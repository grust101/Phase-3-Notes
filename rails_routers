Routers: 

:resources covers all the standard restful routes 
ex resources: :users

URL helpers: 
URL ex: whenever you need to redirect between 2 different domains.

Nested Resources: 

paths may look complex ex: 

ex path:                            ex: controller action

/posts/:post_id/comments              comments#index

don't get confused by the route. for this route you want to see all the comments for a post so you would go to the comments index page to all comments
