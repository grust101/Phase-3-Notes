Manual - 
1. write session controller
 - inherit from app controller
 - config routes resourses :sessions [:new, :create]
  collection do 
    add destroy in a collection... <lu>
 - include those methods in the controller
 
 collection : when a route deals with a collection of objects, if there is no id in the route it is a collection
 member: when a route deals with one object, ALWAYS has an "id" in the route



- set current user in sessions create def

form_for session do |f|
  f.text_field :username
  f.text_field :password
  f.submit "Log in"

create User table with 
- username, email, etc
- you can use password_digest

include has_secure_password in User class


dont need strong params when you are recognizing specific params 
ex: [:user][:password] is safe

current user method goes in application controler
