Strong Parameters:

- instead of writing params[:user] in the create def you can pass strong params 
- strong_params will have a def 
  def strong_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:first_name, :email, :password)
  end
  
  params looks like a hash but it's an "action controller parameter object" and behaves differently because of that
    - built in methods
